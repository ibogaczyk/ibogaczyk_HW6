## Description
The goal of this assignment was to increase familiarity with the features of Github Desktop and Visual Studio Code to make a website using HTML5 and CSS code. 

---

## What did I learn?
Throughout this assignment, I learned many new features through Github Desktop including the importance of using different branches to keep work organized as well as committing new work to create a trail of past updates. When working with HTML and CSS code, I found it vital to validate all of my pages to ensure the integrity of my code which made me problem solve in cases where the answer was not always upfront. Overall, I really enjoyed this assignment and it allowed me to be creative and also learn how to maneuver around Microsoft Azure and upload my work as a web app.
