        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My name is Isabella Bogaczyk but I go by Izzy. I was born in Detroit, Michigan but I grew up in the Des Moines area. I am currently going to The University of Iowa to get my degree in Business Analytics and my International Business Certificate. My favorite things to do in my spare time are cook, read, watch Netflix, travel, watch sports, and walk on outdoor trails. My favorite things to cook are Italian food and soups. Another thing I have been into lately is going to live music concerts. Recently, I went to see Taylor Swift and The Jonas Brothers. I also have tickets to see Post Malone, Kelsea Ballerini, and Ne-Yo. </p>
